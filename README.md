# password-generator

## Challenge:
- This week's challenge introduced the basics of javascript and how to use prompts, commands, arrays, and print out information with functions/console.log. The challenge also focused on setting criteria for password characters and if not met, the user has to restart. 

- The challenge was frustrating at first since I had to keep restarting became I was receiving a syntax error in my console, however, it was something simple as the placement order of my variables and statements. Once I figured that out everything else feel into place on why it functioned (haha) as it did! I'm still not fully sure when to use var or let since my code worked with both so I kept it as original instead of using let.
