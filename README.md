# password-generator

## Challenge:
- This week's challenge introduced the basics of javascript and how to use prompts, commands, and print out information with functions/console.log. The challenge also focused on setting criteria for password characters and if not met, the user has to restart. 

- The challenge was frustrating at first since I had to keep restarting became I was receiving a syntax error in my console, however, it was something simple as placement of my "let" variables and statement orders. Once I figured that out everything else feel into place on why it functioned (haha) as it did!
